### assets
Images, movies, themes

### components
Each component is put in its own folder. The folder has the name of the component. It may also contain a stylesheet.
Each component should be self-contained as much as possible.

### pages
A page is a collection of components. For example the landing page will consist of a navbar and search component.
Each page is placed in its own folder, the name of the folder is the same as that of the page. When you have written a page, add it to routes.js (see pages/routes.js). 
Add a button to landing page that takes you to your page! See ResultsPage.jsx for example. Remember to wrap a Button around Link.
