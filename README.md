1. Clone this Repository
```
git clone https://git.chalmers.se/pomesh/korpi.git 
```
2. Open your favourite terminal (unix-based, backend code may not work on windows)
3. Change Directory into **backend** folder and run run_server.sh to build the backend corpora and run the fastapi server.
You may need to give executable permissions to this file.

./run_server.sh
```
5. Open new terminal and navigate into **frontend**.

### Project Structure
This project is structured into **frontend** and **backend** subfolders.
The **frontend** utilises React and Bootstrap, with vite.
The **backend** uses code from [korpsearch](https://github.com/heatherleaf/korpsearch) by Peter Ljungl√∂f.
